To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Install the Flutter setup if you havenâ€™t already.
2. Unzip the file I sent you, navigate to the folder, and run the following commands:

flutter pub get  
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons  

3. To find available simulator devices, run:

flutter devices  

This will list iPhone simulator devices along with their device IDs.

4. Use the device ID from the output to run the project with:

flutter run -d {your_simulator_device_id}
